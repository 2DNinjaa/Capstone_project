Remote,Zapier,1 day ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/2cbc246c-ecc1-42f2-9f13-c01ad383c7c5,Full Time,Site Reliability Engineer,"
Hi there!
We are seeking a seasoned Site Reliability Engineer to join our team!   Working with our existing SRE team, you'll improve application reliability by using a software engineering approach to operations. You'll develop internal tools and systems for all engineering teams to use. Using site reliability principles and a robust approach to observability, you will not only fix problems but solve the issues that contributed to them when things go wrong.
This position works closely with Release Engineering and other engineering teams in our System's Zone to develop and maintain the tools and systems that support all of Zapier engineering. This role calls upon a broad range of experience and technologies. You'll get to interact with every engineering team in the organization. Maintaining excellent relationships and communicating effectively with those teams regularly is key to success.
Zapier is rapidly scaling and growing, and you will work directly on the applications that support over 5 million customers. When bad things happen, you'll have the support of your team to solve contributing causes, to learn from failures, and to build a robust and resilient system for our customers. 
Building new features and services is a big part of this role. We are continually developing and implementing new ways to support our teams, understanding our customers needs, and becoming experts in site reliability.

About You
We're looking for an experienced engineer who is eager to use software development approaches to operations. You should have a breadth of experience in software development, operations, and be actively practicing site reliability principles.

Ideally, you'll have several years of experience in practicing infrastructure as code, including using tools like Ansible, Terraform, and using platforms like Kubernetes. Well-honed experience with the fundamentals of software development goes a long way here. Python and Go, we do it all. Generalists thrive in this role.
Writing is our primary means of communication, from pull requests, team chat, knowledge sharing, and communicating changes. Excellent writing skills are crucial to success here at Zapier. We are 100% remote and commonly work asynchronously. We even wrote a book on it.
You should feel comfortable taking a default to action. Most decisions are changeable. It's better to deliver something real today over something maybe better later. Sharing context, goals, objectives, and in-progress work in public helps us all achieve a common goal.
Things You’ll Do

Develop new methods for retaining task history
Migrating applications and services from EC2 to Kubernetes
Write custom Kubernetes controllers to improve resilience

IDEO are a global design company committed to creating positive impact. From designing the first manufacturable mouse for Apple to advancing the practice of human-centered design, IDEO has long been at the forefront of creating change through design. Our Munich office is looking for a Creative Technology Lead to join their team.
Role in a nutshell
IDEO Munich is searching for a Creative Technologist to lead and be part of a small multidisciplinary team designing innovative solutions that apply technology and systems to address core user needs.
Why is this role important for IDEO’s work?
Creative Technology Leads apply their expertise in designing technology and developing solutions as well as prototyping experiences by enabling others and enacting our mission of humanizing technology.
Their skillset is critical to our work because they provide new ways to push design, and advocate the generative possibilities enabled by software. They have a knack for combining great design and technology solutions, dealing with ambiguity and delivering impact for our clients. You should expect to apply a range of technologies to these design challenges, including but certainly not limited to the most common JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular.
Once here you will
In the mid-term, lead teams of multidisciplinary designers through the design and prototyping process to innovate new approaches that optimistically bridge technology-to-people and people-to-technology.
Lead projects by hands-on building software products from idea through prototyping to pilots or market launch, the latter in stewardship with our clients and development partners.
Serve as a trusted advisor to our clients, ensuring they are understood and empowered to champion the solutions we develop together.
Collaboratively synthesize research into meaningful design iterations and (digital) prototypes that we can qualitatively test, and quantitatively measure.
Play a key role in growing and nurturing our integrated software design teams through craft leadership, mentoring and external professional relationships.
Build strong, collaborative team dynamics that support individuals to grow towards their goals in service of the team’s and programs’ challenges.
As a Creative Technologist in Munich, we provide the opportunity for you to...
Solve problems in a broad set of domains, including health, consumer technology, mobility, retail, financial services, augmented intelligence, and social impact.
Explore, develop, and apply concepts with emerging technologies, such as new user interaction technologies, and augmented reality.
Create your team’s approach to the latest design challenge. Prototype new ways of supporting design research, engineer a new cross-discipline of software-enabled proof-of-concept.
Balance a role as both guide and contributor, where you can continue to grow in Software Design and technical skills.
What gets us excited?
We are particularly interested in candidates that have demonstrated fluency in the following areas:
You can speak about designing and delivering a software-based product – identifying how technology, business, and user needs interrelate – with non-technical team members and clients in a way that’s accessible, credible, and inspiring.
You have a fluency in modern mobile and web development technologies and an understanding of best practices associated with engineering and delivering software.
When designing for a new platform, or researching options, you have a process for learning to understand how solutions will scale, and how we can best position design for impact on that platform.
You are able to support teams at any point of the process whether that is during research, synthesis or design rather than restricting your focus to the purely technical aspects, prototyping and developing
Experience in launching products to market
APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS
You are likely to have 5+ years designing and building software-based experiences, products, services, or solutions that demonstrate a high level of empathy for the end-user
Experience with full-stack development (front-end, back-end, infrastructure, and data-driven systems)
Team leadership experience in project-based or product context
Ability to dive into new contexts, gain expertise, learn new tools, and inspire others
Excellent communication, collaboration, facilitation, and team leadership.
Ability to work in multidisciplinary teams and a deep understanding of the design process leading into a solution
Please share 2 projects that best represent your capabilities, interests, and leadership, and that demonstrate deep technical expertise in at least one platform, language, or domain. If you have them, please include links to your Github repos, portfolio, blog and/or website and clearly communicate your role in these projects.

Hi! We're Forerunner.
We believe that adaptation is a necessity, not a luxury, and all communities should have access to powerful software that helps them plan for the future. The challenge of climate change is complex — it implicates how municipalities plan, manage capital, and communicate to both residents and higher levels of government. Forerunner helps local communities do these things better by empowering them to access, understand, and mobilize local-level flood risk data at scale. Our software is built to be easy-to-use, so that the planners and floodplain managers preparing for our future can focus on the important stuff.
Currently, we're working with a handful of communities, including the City of New Orleans and Pinellas County, FL. Our engineering team is hard at work on projects that involve extracting information from permits, managing complex datasets, and incorporating geospatial data. Our mission is ambitious, and we have a significant amount of work ahead. As our newest team member, you'll be joining us at a crucial time when you'll have a real impact on our direction and our partner municipalities' success.
About the position:
We're looking for a senior full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience to join us. We would love to hear from you if you're interested in what we do and have a proven track record of leading mid- to large-scale technical initiatives. In general, you might be a good fit if you:

Have partial, or full, familiarity with our technical stack: Node, GraphQL, React, Postgres + PostGIS, Heroku. If not, we would like you to be confident in your ability to ramp up quickly.
Are comfortable with a high degree of ambiguity. Since we are constantly learning a lot from our partners, we are looking for someone who has a bias toward action and can balance the challenging trade-off between quality and speed.
Consider yourself to be a great communicator. We're a small team working remotely, which requires us to be prompt and clear with written and spoken communication.

Our team has a lot to offer.
Forerunner is a seed-stage company with an interdisciplinary team. We are motivated by seemingly intractable problems and work hard to support one another.
We're mission driven. Our mission orients our business strategy and pushes us to work with a sense of urgency. We’re in the weeds — our entire team spends time engaging with our partners in the field to better understand the real-world challenges they face.
We're a small team. We're currently 4 people — you will be the 5th. As a member of our growing team, you will quickly become an invaluable part of our organization and have a meaningful impact on our business and technical direction. We welcome unique perspectives and backgrounds. Your opinion matters and we hope you'll share it.
We're remote. While many of us are based in NYC, we're happy to have you work where you are happiest and most productive. We offer schedule flexibility and ask for accountability in return.
We want you to be happy and healthy. Forerunner offers competitive compensation, health/vision/dental coverage (we pay 70%), and commuter benefits. We also have a quarterly wellness reimbursement so that you can have flexibility in defining what health means to you.
We look forward to meeting you!

Here’s the thing—we hate traditional job descriptions. In our experience, they’re a terrible representation of what a job really entails and never paint a true picture of what it’s like to work at an organization.
That’s why, at Fundera, we do things differently. Instead of presenting you with some run-of-the-mill job description, we offer potential candidates our Job Spotlights. This gives us a chance to tell you the story of us, why you should work here, and what the role is really like.
Who’s Fundera and Why Should I Care?
Fundera is the go-to financial resource for small businesses. We’re here to help entrepreneurs achieve their financial goals and grow businesses as big as their aspirations.
As a catalyst for smart financial decisions, our combination of proprietary technology and financial expertise provides business owners with tailored solutions based on their unique needs and eligibility—helping them prosper, create more jobs, and, ultimately, grow the economy.
Armed with one of the most experienced and passionate leadership teams in the business and backed by the industry’s leading investors, we’ve made a big impact on Main Street in just a short amount of time (Fundera launched in 2014 and has helped 35,000+ small businesses find their best financial solutions and secure over $1 billion in funding).
We’re experiencing massive growth year over year, and our impact on America’s job creators grows with us. We’re looking to further our impact and need incredible, ambitious, mission-oriented people to get there.
If you want to make a difference, if you want to create a workplace and life you love, and if you want to learn more and grow faster than you will at any other point in your career, you should keep reading.
What Is It Like to Work Here?
The easiest way to answer this is to check out our great rating on Glassdoor, take a deep dive into a few of our employee profiles, or look into some of our recent awards, like Crain’s Best Places to Work. Also, don’t forget to peep our Instagram.
For more detail, though, here are a few of our favorite things:

We want people who elevate the game - and offer meaningful equity in our fast-growing company to compensate for top performers.
We offer generous medical, dental, and vision insurance—you shouldn’t have to stress about your health. (And less stress makes you healthier, right?!)
Yes, your Fundera family is very important, but yours at home matters most. That’s why we offer incredibly generous maternity and paternity leave, have a family-friendly office, and love nothing more than seeing our Fundera kiddos at company events and socials.
Everybody needs a little R&R—but we want our team to have more than just a little. You’ll get flexible PTO and we mean legitimately flexible PTO.
We sponsor regular catered lunches with really cool speakers (like the founders of Birchbox, CityRow, and Percolate). We also regularly host company happy hours, and other events such as employee-led trivia and visits to customers. It’s important to bring our team together as much as possible.
Transparency is what our product is built on—and so is our culture. Whether that means regular all-hands meetings, board decks circulated every month, or a highly accessible leadership team, we’re all stakeholders in this company and never forget that.

Ultimately, at Fundera, you get to come to work with a group of supportive, talented, ambitious individuals who will teach you something new every day, whilst building a product that will truly and actually change the lives of America’s small businesses and job creators. We think it’s pretty cool, and think you will, too.
Is This Role Right for Me?
Our Senior Software Engineer will join a team of engineers that are curious, humble, and can hop in and tackle a wide range of projects. We aim to build systems that are reliable and simple, user experiences that are beautiful and frictionless, and internal tools that help us all do our jobs better.

What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?


What's your admin/coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?


What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?

Software Engineer Information Dialogue
Standplaats: Den Haag
Breng jij bij het CBS AI tot leven?
Over het CBS
In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal. Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.
Je gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).
Voor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier
Wie zoeken wij
Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pré is. Vanzelfsprekend kun je user stories opstellen en gemaakte software systematisch testen. Je bent analytisch, creatief, denkt in oplossingen, leert snel, bent een pionier en kan ingewikkelde materie op aansprekende wijze uitleggen aan collega’s die minder van techniek weten. Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.
Waar kom je te werken
Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, één van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot één van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren. De sfeer van dit team is die van een Start-up, met hoge ambities, grote uitdagingen en de gedrevenheid om de Information Dialogue tot een succes te maken.

We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it). On the Frontend (IOS, Android and Web) we adopted and embraced Technologies like Swift, Kotlin, Rx or React.
Breaking down concrete tasks for this position is not that easy, but that's what makes it so exciting. Here are some things we want to entrust you right away:

You write, monitor, scale and architect microservices that comprise our transit backend
You build infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our data stores
You develop services using Node.js & Python
You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions
You write processing pipelines in Python
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features

ABOUT YOU
You should have experience in writing, maintaining & debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.
You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies. 
As it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.

As a member of the OAT engineering team, you will work with the company’s engineers and key employees with the goal to establish OAT as the undisputed leader in open assessment and education technology solutions.
You will be responsible for:

Back-end and/or Front-end Development of the core open source Platform TAO
Back-end and/or Front-end  Development of custom extensions for customers and integration
Contributing to the architecture Key decisions with our architects
Contributing to the continuous integration and deployment operation.

Ultimately, we’re not trying to hire someone who can just close out JIRA tickets. Our primary goal is to find and hire the right people. There’s no shortage of open positions as we gear up for exponential growth and shape the future of learning.

Berlin,Datawrapper,over 1 year ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/861ca26c-dc4b-11e8-8a59-311f92072400,Full Time,Client-facing Software Engineer,"
We are Datawrapper - a web-based charting tool, and we want you to join us as a client-facing software engineer in our office in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg.
What's this exciting new position about? Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.
The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:


Developing new visualization features for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.

Building & maintaining integrations with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.

Extending Datawrapper to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don’t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.

Who we’re looking for:

We’re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, preferrably full-time, but open to flexible work time arrangements.
You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will not be possible to do this job entirely remote. Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.

On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and Svelte. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.
We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. We’re happy to show you how our stack works.


What the ""client-facing"" part entails:

A significant part of the job will involve interacting with users and customers. be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent
That means we're looking for someone with good communication, interpersonal and written skills.

Strong English skills will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.
Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.
If you have any prior work you can show us, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don’t, please don’t feel discouraged to apply.

What we can offer:


A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, where seven of us work (Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans & David). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse & interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.


Flexible working hours. We're looking for someone who wants to work for us at least four days a week. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.


A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere. We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.


We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills & experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:

Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.
Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.
We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.
As a Strider, you’ll find a learning opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:

Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.
Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.
Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.
Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.

A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer
You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.
You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:
9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.
12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride
12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.
1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.
1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.
2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.
6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.
What you’ll be doing

Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.
Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.
Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.
Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).
Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.

You’re a fit for Stride if you have:

3+ years of software development experience
Experience in multiple programming languages
Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks
Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming

What you can expect from us:

Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about
Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)
Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace
No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC
$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development

For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.
For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:

We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.
Skills & Requirements
Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.
We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.
About Analytics Fire
Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.
“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”

Remote,Impala,5 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/fc4dabda-54b6-454e-8187-d831e887e040,Full Time,Senior Fullstack Engineer (Remote),"
Hello!
Thanks for taking a look at the job description for a Remote Senior Fullstack Developer at Impala. We felt a little bit impersonal just throwing you right in there with words like “revolutionizing” and “disrupting”.
As such, we want you to know that the person that wrote this job description apologises in advance for any clichés, tropes or sudden-insecurity-driven-panic-attacks that you might find in the description below.
What is Impala?
Impala makes building travel software incredibly easy. We provide hotels with a powerful data management platform that makes connecting to software, hardware and room distributors extremely easy. Think Twilio for Travel.
We launched the product in January 2019 and since then have grown at - quite frankly - a ridiculous old clip. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points.
We are a growing team of exceptional people split across engineering, product and commercial that have built a fantastic community.
Where is Impala going?
We’re supported by some of the best investors in the business, the early-stage backers behind Deliveroo, PillPack, SecretEscapes, Zoopla, Trivago, Monzo, Travelperk, Transferwise, Airbnb, GetYourGuide, Omio, Spotify and more!
They’re on board because of the opportunity that lies before us - revolutionizing a 1.6 trillion dollar market that’s been out-of-date for 20 years.
They also share our vision of democratising travel and enabling innovation across the industry.
Within the next two years, 25% of hotel bookings worldwide will flow through Impala technology and the product that we’re building will support the entire ecosystem of travel technology (we already have over a thousand companies signed up).
Anyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala and to achieve this we’re growing the team extensively within the next year. Now is the most exciting time to be joining Impala as we go through a large push to scale up!
A brief overview of what you will be doing here:
-Acting as a technical authority for a broad and distributed set of services with high availability & security requirements.
-Improving the security, reliability and quality of our products.
-Ideating, developing and iterating new features, enabling our technology partners to add value to hotels and travellers.
-Leading and mentoring developers, instilling best practice and supporting on career growth.
-Working directly with stakeholders; part and parcel of working in an autonomous, metric-driven development team.
You should join us if:
-You have experience in the design and end-to-end development of Node-based services.
-You have experience leading the development of mature, large scale / high traffic systems and services.
-You’ve worked with high availability requirements and know how to lead the development of secure, reliable services.
-You feel comfortable working closely with product owners, designers and other stakeholders.
-You are extremely collaborative, Impala’s engineering team is not political, everyone has great ideas and should be open to input. We have no space for brilliant jerks.
-You are passionate about customer experience and building high-quality maintainable software that looks and works fantastically.
Where will you work?
This is a remote position. This means you can work from anywhere +/- 2 Hours of London, timezone wise (and less than a 3 hour flight).
We are a remote-first company, our whole engineering team is fully distributed! This was a very deliberate choice to prioritise work-life balance and ensure we’re able to accommodate the best people in Europe. We have loads of remote initiatives to ensure you’re fully setup!:
-We give you an additional generous Personalised Workspace Budget for things like monitors, keyboards, desk chairs and headphones.
-We offer an office stipend (you can furnish a home office with a generous monthly stipend, or choose a co-working space near you).
-You’ll travel once a quarter to meet and socialise with the rest of the engineering team somewhere in Europe.
-You’ll have a generous Social Budget to travel to London based social events. You'll also have a special 'Loved Ones Budget' that we're incredibly proud to offer, we'll tell you more about that when we speak to you!
-We have a dedicated Remote Experience Manager in the team, who, amongst other things, will be ensuring you're happy, integrated and empowered whilst working remotely.
-We will give you a brand new high-spec laptop when you start, giving you the choice between a Thinkpad or Mac.
Please note, we only accept candidates in Western Europe because of timezone and travel time differences. We make no exceptions (we don’t have time to!).
What you will get in return?
-We reward Impalans with super competitive salaries and regular reviews. Whether you're an individual contributor or you want to manage people, there's plenty of opportunity to develop your skills and boost your earning potential. We offer 3.5x the average annual raise in the UK, even if you remain within the same role.
-We’re in the top 14% of companies in the UK for holiday that we offer, at 36 days.
-One Unsick day off per year, to keep up with proactive health admin - so you can finally sort that trip to the dentist and get those health screens that you never have time to do.
-A stipend to set up your ideal place of work. You can choose between the option of £150 per month to build out your home office, or we’ll pay for your membership at a coworking space near you up to £350.
-Truly flexible working. Work remotely, with a budget given to you to set up your workspace in the way you want. We also offer extended lunch break options and loads more. No commutes no more!
-Sustainable growth and career progression opportunities.
-We invest in your development with a generous annual Professional Development budget, and we will support you to realise your potential.
-Fun and inclusive monthly social events, from go-karting to mini golf to karaoke, giving Impalans across Europe the chance to catch up and recharge.

-A super strong and pro-active focus on mental and physical wellbeing. Our Health and Wellbeing scheme offers Impalans a range of options; from Vitality health insurance to a monthly gym membership reimbursement, plus heaps more.

-A Social Budget to travel to/from & stay in London for a night, for our monthly Impala Social.

Backend Engineer (d/f/m) for Mobility Core & Services Squad
 
Hi,
We are Anton, Ben, Bernd, Delia, Iulia, Jan, Mark, Nils, Patrick, Philip and Ulf from the Mobility Core & Services (MCS) squad. As an interdisciplinary team we focus on integrating mobility service providers for car- sharing, scooters, bike-sharing and ride-hailing such as car2go, TIER or FREE NOW (formerly mytaxi) into our urban mobility platform. We care greatly about quality, scalability, ease of use and a great user experience. We’re looking for a backend-focused engineer (d/f/m) to join our squad.
FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US
Daimler AG and BMW Group are bundling their mobility services in the areas of Carsharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodal Platforms, and create a new global player comprising of five joint ventures. moovel Group is joining forces with ReachNow - and becomes REACH NOW
Our vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of two large global corporations, but at the heart of it we still are a start-up. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 150 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at three locations - Hamburg, Berlin, and Portland.
HOW THE ROLE WORKS
We are building services that provide a fully fledged feature set of urban mobility service providers. Our backend enables the moovel mobility app to find nearby mobility options like car or bike-sharing as well as scooters and ride-hailing services. It also allows booking functionality and handles payment.
Our services interact with moovel’s mobility platform as well as external APIs. Many of our services are also exposed to external partners, so they have to be well documented, stable and easy to use. Implementing new services in a consistent way is also very important to us.
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO

Work in the mobility core & services (MCS) squad together with other backend engineers, mobile engineers, QA engineers and designers
Build microservices with Node.js written in TypeScript and deployed on AWS
Design and implement APIs for discovering mobility points, booking flows and payment for mobility services.
Integrate APIs from third-party mobility service providers into our platform.
As we follow agile principles, you will participate in defining our products and building them. Your input is valued!

ABOUT YOU

You are an experienced backend-focussed software engineer and like building services using well- defined APIs
You know about Node.js (ideally TypeScript) or are willing to learn it. We believe in hiring great engineers, not programming language experts.
You know how to operate services in production: deploying, performance monitoring, tracing problems, and optimization are part of the things you have done in the past
We run our services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and monitor them with New Relic. Knowledge with those technologies is a plus, but not mandatory.
You are able to communicate verbally and written in English (we communicate mostly in English).

BENEFITS

Choose your own hardware
Working with newest technologies & microservices
Company pension plan
Weekly breakfast, coffee & fresh fruits
Monthly mobility budget
Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts
Working on products with a high impact on society
International teams
Child care allowance

Security Clearance


Sandia is required by DOE to conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Applicants for employment need to be able to obtain and maintain a DOE Q-level security clearance and SCI access, both of which require US citizenship. SCI access may also require a polygraph examination. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain these levels of access may be impacted.
Applicants offered employment with Sandia are subject to a federal background investigation to meet the requirements for access to classified information or matter if the duties of the position require a DOE security clearance. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause a clearance to be denied or terminated by the DOE, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.

Security Clearance


Sandia is required by DOE to conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Applicants for employment need to be able to obtain and maintain a DOE Q-level security clearance and SCI access, both of which require US citizenship. SCI access may also require a polygraph examination. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain these levels of access may be impacted.
Applicants offered employment with Sandia are subject to a federal background investigation to meet the requirements for access to classified information or matter if the duties of the position require a DOE security clearance. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause a clearance to be denied or terminated by the DOE, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.
