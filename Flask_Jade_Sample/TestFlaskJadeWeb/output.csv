Zurich,Squirro,over 1 year ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/c307e4ca-d6a6-11e8-8f6e-f00ef74f7cb0,Full Time,Senior Python Engineer,"
We’re looking for senior engineers with solid Python skills to join our team, which is building a platform, called Squirro, for unstructured data analysis.
Squirro can ingest data from anywhere, be it public on the web or social medium or internal, such as a CRM, database or ITSM system, and add structure to it so that it can be delivered to business users using our dashboard visualisations or consumed by other systems using our APIs. We add structure to unstructured data by employing a range of techniques, from statistical and Bayesian models to supervised and unsupervised machine learning which we serve to our customers as a unified and patented technology we call Smartfilters. Meanwhile, for our users, we provide a simple interface to access these technologies so that anyone with basic analytical skills can get value out of their companies unstructured data.
Our customers are some of the largest banks and financial institutions in the world, across the US, UK, EU, Switzerland and Asia. Many of our customers are just beginning to discover the potential of unstructured data analysis and we’re excited by the opportunity as an early mover in this young market. While we host some of these customers in the cloud, the majority prefer to install Squirro on-premise for security reasons.
We need you to help us build out and scale this platform, as our customers apply it to ever growing volumes of data and discover new ways to structure and analyse that data.
Required Qualifications

Exceptional programming experience in Python
Extensive knowledge of UNIX/Linux from a developers perspective
Strong track record in software systems design, from initial implementation to performance optimisation and scaling
Experience developing professionally as part of a team, giving and receiving code reviews, test-driven development etc.
Good communication skills with fluency in English
Swiss citizenship or work permit in Switzerland, or living and working in UK, EU or EFTA member state. We’d love to hire people worldwide but Swiss immigration law makes this problematic except in rare cases.

Nice to Have

BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science or related technical field
Experience with information retrieval technologies (Elasticsearch, Lucene)
Comfortable working with large datasets and designing systems able to process and scale up to large data volumes
Familiarity with RESTful web services and microservices architectures
Experience with MySQL, Redis, nginx, Zookeeper and other technologies in the Squirro stack
Familiarity with AWS, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible and other DevOps related tools
Awareness of machine learning as applied to text analysis

Working with Us
Squirro is a Swiss startup with an international flavour. Our team of passionate technology geeks and entrepreneurs mix local “Swissness” with American, German, French, Russian, Indian, Portuguese, Polish and British into an all-round startup team that combines the excellence of the ETH and EPFL with experience from technology companies such as Microsoft and Google as well as Swiss players such as local.ch and DeinDeal.
We love Python and ElasticSearch on the server side and JavaScript, backbone.js, React, D3 and more on the client side. We work with git, believe in testing, code reviews, continuous integration and continuous deployment. Our work is structured loosely around scrum with help from Jira and the Atlassian tool suite. We take design and user experience seriously and apply machine learning in the context of text analysis.
Most of all we’re serious about building a world-class company and our compensation package includes shares because we believe our employees should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication.
Our engineering office is in the heart of Zürich, with easy access to public transport.

Backend Engineer (d/f/m) for Mobility Core & Services Squad
 
Hi,
We are Anton, Ben, Bernd, Delia, Iulia, Jan, Mark, Nils, Patrick, Philip and Ulf from the Mobility Core & Services (MCS) squad. As an interdisciplinary team we focus on integrating mobility service providers for car- sharing, scooters, bike-sharing and ride-hailing such as car2go, TIER or FREE NOW (formerly mytaxi) into our urban mobility platform. We care greatly about quality, scalability, ease of use and a great user experience. We’re looking for a backend-focused engineer (d/f/m) to join our squad.
FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US
Daimler AG and BMW Group are bundling their mobility services in the areas of Carsharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodal Platforms, and create a new global player comprising of five joint ventures. moovel Group is joining forces with ReachNow - and becomes REACH NOW
Our vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of two large global corporations, but at the heart of it we still are a start-up. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 150 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at three locations - Hamburg, Berlin, and Portland.
HOW THE ROLE WORKS
We are building services that provide a fully fledged feature set of urban mobility service providers. Our backend enables the moovel mobility app to find nearby mobility options like car or bike-sharing as well as scooters and ride-hailing services. It also allows booking functionality and handles payment.
Our services interact with moovel’s mobility platform as well as external APIs. Many of our services are also exposed to external partners, so they have to be well documented, stable and easy to use. Implementing new services in a consistent way is also very important to us.
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO

Work in the mobility core & services (MCS) squad together with other backend engineers, mobile engineers, QA engineers and designers
Build microservices with Node.js written in TypeScript and deployed on AWS
Design and implement APIs for discovering mobility points, booking flows and payment for mobility services.
Integrate APIs from third-party mobility service providers into our platform.
As we follow agile principles, you will participate in defining our products and building them. Your input is valued!

ABOUT YOU

You are an experienced backend-focussed software engineer and like building services using well- defined APIs
You know about Node.js (ideally TypeScript) or are willing to learn it. We believe in hiring great engineers, not programming language experts.
You know how to operate services in production: deploying, performance monitoring, tracing problems, and optimization are part of the things you have done in the past
We run our services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and monitor them with New Relic. Knowledge with those technologies is a plus, but not mandatory.
You are able to communicate verbally and written in English (we communicate mostly in English).

BENEFITS

Choose your own hardware
Working with newest technologies & microservices
Company pension plan
Weekly breakfast, coffee & fresh fruits
Monthly mobility budget
Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts
Working on products with a high impact on society
International teams
Child care allowance
Flexible working hours

Ben jij een kei in je vak en vind je het ook leuk om jouw kennis over te dragen en je team te coachen? En wil jij, net als wij, niets liever dan gave online oplossingen ontwikkelen voor aansprekende klanten?
Axendo heeft voor haar locatie in Leusden (bij Amersfoort) een vacature voor een
Senior Front-End Developer
voor 32-40 uur
Wat ga je doen als Front-End Developer?
Vanuit jouw ervaring begeleid je front-end collega's bij het uitvoeren van hun werkzaamheden. Je vindt het leuk om over jouw vakgebied zaken duidelijk uit te leggen aan anderen in het development team.
Uiteenlopende projecten liggen voor je klaar om samen met je collega’s in sprints opgepakt te worden. Jij zorgt als front-end developer voor de verbinding tussen het design en de techniek. Je onderzoekt, ontwerpt, ontwikkelt en implementeert. Je bent daarnaast de vraagbaak als het gaat om wat precies goed werkt op het gebied van gebruiksvriendelijkheid en toegankelijkheid.
Wat jou uniek maakt

We zoeken een slimme developer met circa 5 jaar werkervaring
Het geeft je energie om mensen op een coachende wijze naar een hoger plan te tillen
Je hebt gedegen kennis van HTML, CSS precompilers, Javascript, BEM en Gulp/NPM. Het is mooi als je ook ervaring hebt met Javascript frameworks zoals React of Vue.js.
Als je kennis hebt van WCAG, SEO of UX/UI, dan heb je een streepje voor.

Wat biedt Axendo jou?

Een salaris van 3.000 tot 4.500 Euro bruto per maand. Inschaling vindt plaats op basis van jouw ervaring.

Een fijne-, ruime werkplek, pensioen, reiskostenvergoeding, een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget, een snelle laptop met twee of meer schermen, lekkere koffie, gratis parkeren voor de deur en iedere dag een geheel verzorgde lunch vinden wij vanzelfsprekend.
Een hecht, gezellig en professioneel team van 15 collega’s en wij werken agile.
Circa 4 keer per jaar leuke teamuitjes, waaronder bijvoorbeeld een uitgebreid kerstdiner met partner. Daarnaast gaan we ook geregeld met elkaar en met klanten o.a. voetballen, curlen en squashen.

Over Axendo
Goed werkgeverschap betekent voor ons op de eerste plaats vooral een persoonlijke benadering. Wij vinden het heel belangrijk dat jij helemaal jezelf kunt zijn en lekker in je vel zit. Zo krijg je bij ons alle ruimte om je verder te ontwikkelen door bijvoorbeeld het bijwonen van interessante meetups, congressen, kennissessies en/of het volgen van relevante trainingen/opleidingen. Bovendien kun je rekenen op veel vrijheid en eigen verantwoordelijkheid. We zijn nuchter, innovatief, werken in een open cultuur, hebben zeer korte lijnen en leren graag van elkaar. Plezier op en in je werk staat bij ons hoog in het vaandel, zo spelen we graag in de pauze een potje FIFA, maken een wandeling uitgestippeld door Pokémon GO of nemen de laatste zelfgemaakte speciaalbieren door (tijdens onze vrijdagmiddagborrels 😉).
Wie zijn wij
Een digitaal bureau dat bestaat uit specialisten die trots zijn op hun vak. We maken graag mooie dingen die voor gebruikers gewoon werken. Simpel als resultaat. Met de weg er naartoe soms moeilijk, dat is onze uitdaging!
Het in hechte, multidisciplinaire teams  bouwen aan de best schaalbare online platformen voor grote groepen gebruikers, dat is onze kracht. Waarbij we altijd rekening houden met de diversiteit aan mensen die deze platformen (gaan) gebruiken. Of ze nou (kleuren-)blind zijn of moeite hebben met lezen. Zo werken wij o.a. met veel trots voor iamsterdam.com, JINC, HandicapNL, het Watersportverbond en niet te vergeten de RET.

We are seeking a seasoned Site Reliability Engineer to join our team!   Working with our existing SRE team, you'll improve application reliability by using a software engineering approach to operations. You'll develop internal tools and systems for all engineering teams to use. Using site reliability principles and a robust approach to observability, you will not only fix problems but solve the issues that contributed to them when things go wrong.
This position works closely with Release Engineering and other engineering teams in our System's Zone to develop and maintain the tools and systems that support all of Zapier engineering. This role calls upon a broad range of experience and technologies. You'll get to interact with every engineering team in the organization. Maintaining excellent relationships and communicating effectively with those teams regularly is key to success.
Zapier is rapidly scaling and growing, and you will work directly on the applications that support over 5 million customers. When bad things happen, you'll have the support of your team to solve contributing causes, to learn from failures, and to build a robust and resilient system for our customers. 
Building new features and services is a big part of this role. We are continually developing and implementing new ways to support our teams, understanding our customers needs, and becoming experts in site reliability.
If you’re interested in taking your career to the next level at a fast-growing and profitable startup, then read on.
About You
We're looking for an experienced engineer who is eager to use software development approaches to operations. You should have a breadth of experience in software development, operations, and be actively practicing site reliability principles. There is a lot to learn, and we're continually improving our approaches to SRE. There are plenty of learning opportunities. We don't expect you to know it all.
Ideally, you'll have several years of experience in practicing infrastructure as code, including using tools like Ansible, Terraform, and using platforms like Kubernetes. Well-honed experience with the fundamentals of software development goes a long way here. Python and Go, we do it all. Generalists thrive in this role.
Writing is our primary means of communication, from pull requests, team chat, knowledge sharing, and communicating changes. Excellent writing skills are crucial to success here at Zapier. We are 100% remote and commonly work asynchronously. We even wrote a book on it.
You should feel comfortable taking a default to action. Most decisions are changeable. It's better to deliver something real today over something maybe better later. Sharing context, goals, objectives, and in-progress work in public helps us all achieve a common goal.
Things You’ll Do

Develop new methods for retaining task history
Migrating applications and services from EC2 to Kubernetes
Write custom Kubernetes controllers to improve resilience
Create deployment pipelines in ArgoCD
Develop autoscaling strategies to handle bursts in workloads
Implementing OPA to enforce policies across our Kubernetes Clusters
Deploying ProxySQL for pooling connections against MySQL databases
Have an enormous impact working closely with teams across the organization. Be an advocate for site reliability principles.
As a part of our All Hands Support initiative, help customers have the best possible experience with Zapier

We have a non-standard application process. To jump-start the process we ask a few questions we normally would ask at the start of an interview. This helps speed up the process and lets us get to know you a bit better right out of the gate. Please make sure to answer each question.
After you apply, you are going to hear back from us, even if we don't seem like a good fit. In fact, throughout the process, we strive to make sure you never go more than seven days without hearing from us.

We're excited to work with talented and empathetic people no matter their race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, or age. Our code of conduct provides a beacon for the kind of company we strive to be, and we celebrate our differences because those differences are what allow us to make a product that serves a global user base.

Munich,IDEO,4 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/e3e5d655-5358-44a8-b0f3-c682b6b453b0,Full Time,Creative Technology Lead,"
IDEO are a global design company committed to creating positive impact. From designing the first manufacturable mouse for Apple to advancing the practice of human-centered design, IDEO has long been at the forefront of creating change through design. Our Munich office is looking for a Creative Technology Lead to join their team.
Role in a nutshell
IDEO Munich is searching for a Creative Technologist to lead and be part of a small multidisciplinary team designing innovative solutions that apply technology and systems to address core user needs.
Why is this role important for IDEO’s work?
Creative Technology Leads apply their expertise in designing technology and developing solutions as well as prototyping experiences by enabling others and enacting our mission of humanizing technology.
Their skillset is critical to our work because they provide new ways to push design, and advocate the generative possibilities enabled by software. They have a knack for combining great design and technology solutions, dealing with ambiguity and delivering impact for our clients. You should expect to apply a range of technologies to these design challenges, including but certainly not limited to the most common JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular.
Once here you will
In the mid-term, lead teams of multidisciplinary designers through the design and prototyping process to innovate new approaches that optimistically bridge technology-to-people and people-to-technology.
Lead projects by hands-on building software products from idea through prototyping to pilots or market launch, the latter in stewardship with our clients and development partners.
Serve as a trusted advisor to our clients, ensuring they are understood and empowered to champion the solutions we develop together.
Collaboratively synthesize research into meaningful design iterations and (digital) prototypes that we can qualitatively test, and quantitatively measure.
Play a key role in growing and nurturing our integrated software design teams through craft leadership, mentoring and external professional relationships.
Build strong, collaborative team dynamics that support individuals to grow towards their goals in service of the team’s and programs’ challenges.
As a Creative Technologist in Munich, we provide the opportunity for you to...
Solve problems in a broad set of domains, including health, consumer technology, mobility, retail, financial services, augmented intelligence, and social impact.
Explore, develop, and apply concepts with emerging technologies, such as new user interaction technologies, and augmented reality.
Create your team’s approach to the latest design challenge. Prototype new ways of supporting design research, engineer a new cross-discipline of software-enabled proof-of-concept.
Balance a role as both guide and contributor, where you can continue to grow in Software Design and technical skills.
What gets us excited?
We are particularly interested in candidates that have demonstrated fluency in the following areas:
You can speak about designing and delivering a software-based product – identifying how technology, business, and user needs interrelate – with non-technical team members and clients in a way that’s accessible, credible, and inspiring.
You have a fluency in modern mobile and web development technologies and an understanding of best practices associated with engineering and delivering software.
When designing for a new platform, or researching options, you have a process for learning to understand how solutions will scale, and how we can best position design for impact on that platform.
You are able to support teams at any point of the process whether that is during research, synthesis or design rather than restricting your focus to the purely technical aspects, prototyping and developing
Experience in launching products to market
APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS
You are likely to have 5+ years designing and building software-based experiences, products, services, or solutions that demonstrate a high level of empathy for the end-user
Experience with full-stack development (front-end, back-end, infrastructure, and data-driven systems)
Team leadership experience in project-based or product context
Ability to dive into new contexts, gain expertise, learn new tools, and inspire others
Excellent communication, collaboration, facilitation, and team leadership.
Ability to work in multidisciplinary teams and a deep understanding of the design process leading into a solution
Please share 2 projects that best represent your capabilities, interests, and leadership, and that demonstrate deep technical expertise in at least one platform, language, or domain. If you have them, please include links to your Github repos, portfolio, blog and/or website and clearly communicate your role in these projects.

Utrecht,Rabobank,12 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/fd4cb3ba-0e82-4162-80e0-fd776b1a651f,Full Time,Credit Risk Modeler,"
Credit Risk Modeler
Imagine…
That we’ll give you the opportunity and freedom to build or validate the most effective models. Are you ready to put your skills to the test? As a Credit Risk Modeler will you build or validate risk models that have a direct impact on bank business and the lives of millions of customers. We’ve got a challenge you can really sink your teeth into.
Making a difference

Depending on your experience and skills, you will build, test, develop and/or validate comprehensive risk models that support the bank’s ambitions and safeguard our customers
Think here of mathematical, data-driven credit risk models
You will work closely with colleagues and stakeholders of all nationalities to solve highly complex challenges and establish workable models that the bank can put into practice
You’ll work intensely with a variety of stakeholders, including Risk Management, Finance and external regulators (like DNB and ECB), IT and more
So in addition to putting your modelling skills to the test, we’ll also ask you to contribute to the team dynamic in a positive way

Your technology stack consists of Python, Matlab, SQL and GIT, or comparable packages and programming languages.
With each other
Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We bring teams of talented people together to develop the next generation of risk models that not only thrill our regulators, but also drive our business forward. Both Risk Modelling (ALM & Credit) and Model Validation operate in an open atmosphere of collaboration and service. We know that no one can solve the complex challenges of risk modelling on her/his own. It takes a well-rounded team of experienced professionals who are willing to look beyond their own accomplishments and work together to achieve a common objective. Whether it’s safeguarding Rabobank’s €200 billion mortgage portfolio, or calculating the risk-reward ratio of a large multi-national wholesale client, you will play a key role in processes that affect nearly every aspect of the bank’s business.
With you as a Risk Modeler, you will strike a balance between strong leadership and open collaboration, with team members like:
Maikel, Team Lead IFRS9: “No one can solve the complex issues of modelling alone. That’s why the team works closely together to contribute to the overall result. You won’t ever hear ‘that’s not my job’. Much more often, you’ll hear, ‘how can I help?’ The person who leads this team should not be afraid to get her/his hands dirty. Every member of the team contributes. There are no ivory towers.”
With you
If we were to ask your friends to describe you in a few key words, the answer would be: customer-focused, confident, and able to take on challenges with confidence and flexibility.
We’re searching for Credit Risk Modelers of all levels, but particularly mid- and senior-level analysts. Got what it takes to join our team? Then you will likely have:

A master's degree in a quantitative field (econometrics, mathematics, physics, AI or similar)
A passion for using/developing models to solve complex problems
Familiarity with Python would be of great value
Experience with programming is a plus: if you speak Matlab, SQL or GIT, you’ve got a head start. If you don’t, we’ll teach you
Minimum of 3 years experience in – and affinity for – working with data
It’s important to note that we aren’t just looking for top Risk Modelers who are great at modelling. You’ll also need to be a true team player, with excellent communication skills in English, the ability to take other (non-analyst’s) interests into consideration. Timing is always a factor in what we do, so you will need to be able to perform well under pressure, and manage your time effectively. Flexibility and adaptability are definitely expected

Growing a better world together
Rabobank is a financial services provider for 7.1 million customers in 40 countries. But did you know that we are also working to make the world a better place? We do so in countless ways, such as:

Actively protecting our clients by ensuring that the funds we lend and the mortgages we provide are well within acceptable risk levels;
Working toward a new generation of risk models that not only fulfil regulatory requirements, but also allow us to expand our reach and help more people, communities and societies to thrive.Safeguarding our investments in nature, culture, agriculture and development with risk models that sustain and advance the bank’s position.

Interested?
Do you want to become the ideal version of yourself? We would love to help you achieve this by focusing firmly on your growth, development, and investing in an environment where you keep learning every day. We give you the space to innovate and initiate. In this way, we offer you numerous opportunities to grow and help you exceed your expectations, to do the right thing exceptionally well, and to therefore grow as a professional. In addition, with us (on the basis of a 40 hour working week), you can expect:

A gross annual salary between €53k and €110k, depending on your experience and Seniority.
A thirteenth month and holiday pay;
An Employee Benefit Budget of your gross monthly salary. You decide how to spend this budget. This may include purchasing extra leave days, or making extra pension contributions;
Flexible working times and location-independent working;
100% reimbursement of commuting costs if you travel by public transport. Do you still prefer to travel by car or motorbike? Then choose a home/work travel allowance;
A pension scheme, to which your contribution is only 5%.

Hi! We're Forerunner.
We believe that adaptation is a necessity, not a luxury, and all communities should have access to powerful software that helps them plan for the future. The challenge of climate change is complex — it implicates how municipalities plan, manage capital, and communicate to both residents and higher levels of government. Forerunner helps local communities do these things better by empowering them to access, understand, and mobilize local-level flood risk data at scale. Our software is built to be easy-to-use, so that the planners and floodplain managers preparing for our future can focus on the important stuff.
Currently, we're working with a handful of communities, including the City of New Orleans and Pinellas County, FL. Our engineering team is hard at work on projects that involve extracting information from permits, managing complex datasets, and incorporating geospatial data. Our mission is ambitious, and we have a significant amount of work ahead. As our newest team member, you'll be joining us at a crucial time when you'll have a real impact on our direction and our partner municipalities' success.
About the position:
We're looking for a senior full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience to join us. We would love to hear from you if you're interested in what we do and have a proven track record of leading mid- to large-scale technical initiatives. In general, you might be a good fit if you:

Have partial, or full, familiarity with our technical stack: Node, GraphQL, React, Postgres + PostGIS, Heroku. If not, we would like you to be confident in your ability to ramp up quickly.
Are comfortable with a high degree of ambiguity. Since we are constantly learning a lot from our partners, we are looking for someone who has a bias toward action and can balance the challenging trade-off between quality and speed.
Consider yourself to be a great communicator. We're a small team working remotely, which requires us to be prompt and clear with written and spoken communication.

Our team has a lot to offer.
Forerunner is a seed-stage company with an interdisciplinary team. We are motivated by seemingly intractable problems and work hard to support one another.
We're mission driven. Our mission orients our business strategy and pushes us to work with a sense of urgency. We’re in the weeds — our entire team spends time engaging with our partners in the field to better understand the real-world challenges they face.
We're a small team. We're currently 4 people — you will be the 5th. As a member of our growing team, you will quickly become an invaluable part of our organization and have a meaningful impact on our business and technical direction. We welcome unique perspectives and backgrounds. Your opinion matters and we hope you'll share it.
We're remote. While many of us are based in NYC, we're happy to have you work where you are happiest and most productive. We offer schedule flexibility and ask for accountability in return.
We want you to be happy and healthy. Forerunner offers competitive compensation, health/vision/dental coverage (we pay 70%), and commuter benefits. We also have a quarterly wellness reimbursement so that you can have flexibility in defining what health means to you.
We look forward to meeting you!

In this project, we are connecting a lot of different data sources, analyze data using statistical models and provide a simple user interface for our pricing team so they can run simulations on their own.
Your first task could include an extension of this product. You would work hand-in-hand with our data analysts in order to improve statistical models that were developed by them, add more data sources, improve the user interface and the overall - still PoC-ish - architecture.

SREs are people who take engineering-based approaches to solve operations problems: we like infrastructure, we like seeing how big complicated things work, and most importantly, we gain great satisfaction from making it better. We have backgrounds in lots of things -- of course, Computer Science, System Administration, Networking, Mathematics, and Engineering generally, but you can also find folks who've worked in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Statistics, and even English. 
SREs build, monitor, and maintain the systems and infrastructure that ensure our customers can quickly access their data and run workloads whenever and wherever they need to. We identify service problems and areas for improvement, and we follow up by fixing those problems. Our work is key to the success of many of the Microsoft services you'll have heard of, and a number you haven't. There are very few bits of Microsoft which aren't touched by SREs in some way or other. 
SREs come in two kinds: SRE-SWE (people with a software engineering background), and SRE-SE (people with a systems engineering background).

New York,Fundera,24 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/7b7d433d-caf3-4b1b-9cf1-e4c25d560a53,Full Time,Senior Software Engineer,"
Fundera
Here’s the thing—we hate traditional job descriptions. In our experience, they’re a terrible representation of what a job really entails and never paint a true picture of what it’s like to work at an organization.
That’s why, at Fundera, we do things differently. Instead of presenting you with some run-of-the-mill job description, we offer potential candidates our Job Spotlights. This gives us a chance to tell you the story of us, why you should work here, and what the role is really like.
Who’s Fundera and Why Should I Care?
Fundera is the go-to financial resource for small businesses. We’re here to help entrepreneurs achieve their financial goals and grow businesses as big as their aspirations.
As a catalyst for smart financial decisions, our combination of proprietary technology and financial expertise provides business owners with tailored solutions based on their unique needs and eligibility—helping them prosper, create more jobs, and, ultimately, grow the economy.
Armed with one of the most experienced and passionate leadership teams in the business and backed by the industry’s leading investors, we’ve made a big impact on Main Street in just a short amount of time (Fundera launched in 2014 and has helped 35,000+ small businesses find their best financial solutions and secure over $1 billion in funding).
We’re experiencing massive growth year over year, and our impact on America’s job creators grows with us. We’re looking to further our impact and need incredible, ambitious, mission-oriented people to get there.
If you want to make a difference, if you want to create a workplace and life you love, and if you want to learn more and grow faster than you will at any other point in your career, you should keep reading.
What Is It Like to Work Here?
The easiest way to answer this is to check out our great rating on Glassdoor, take a deep dive into a few of our employee profiles, or look into some of our recent awards, like Crain’s Best Places to Work. Also, don’t forget to peep our Instagram.
For more detail, though, here are a few of our favorite things:

We want people who elevate the game - and offer meaningful equity in our fast-growing company to compensate for top performers.
We offer generous medical, dental, and vision insurance—you shouldn’t have to stress about your health. (And less stress makes you healthier, right?!)
Yes, your Fundera family is very important, but yours at home matters most. That’s why we offer incredibly generous maternity and paternity leave, have a family-friendly office, and love nothing more than seeing our Fundera kiddos at company events and socials.
Everybody needs a little R&R—but we want our team to have more than just a little. You’ll get flexible PTO and we mean legitimately flexible PTO.
We sponsor regular catered lunches with really cool speakers (like the founders of Birchbox, CityRow, and Percolate). We also regularly host company happy hours, and other events such as employee-led trivia and visits to customers. It’s important to bring our team together as much as possible.
Transparency is what our product is built on—and so is our culture. Whether that means regular all-hands meetings, board decks circulated every month, or a highly accessible leadership team, we’re all stakeholders in this company and never forget that.

Ultimately, at Fundera, you get to come to work with a group of supportive, talented, ambitious individuals who will teach you something new every day, whilst building a product that will truly and actually change the lives of America’s small businesses and job creators. We think it’s pretty cool, and think you will, too.
Is This Role Right for Me?
Our Senior Software Engineer will join a team of engineers that are curious, humble, and can hop in and tackle a wide range of projects. We aim to build systems that are reliable and simple, user experiences that are beautiful and frictionless, and internal tools that help us all do our jobs better. If you’re interested in the position, here are a few things you’ll get to do and the qualifications that will make you successful in this role.
As our Senior Software Engineer, You’ll Get to...
Contribute ideas for projects to drive the team forward.

Develop new features that surprise and delight our users.
Work up and down the stack, from schema changes to front end javascript in the same day.
Work with product managers and designers to build a well-rounded product.
Measure and graph your features so we can know how something is performing.
Constantly be learning from teammates, as well as sharing any knowledge and skills you have with
others.
Create with empathy - always considering the end user and be an advocate for their experience.

We’re Looking for People Who Have...

5+ years of real world experience.
Some familiarity with Fundera’s current stack or similar technologies: Rails, React, AWS, Postgres,
Docker, CircleCI, StatsD, InfluxDB, Grafana.
Proficiency in Unix environments.
Experience working with web systems.
Excellent interpersonal skills.
A passion for helping small businesses.

Location: 100% Remote (the team is based in Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia)
Start date: ASAP
Hours: 20 to 30 hours a week, according to your expertise and availability.
Salary: Appropriate to the level of experience. Negotiable to your expectations.

Our company
We are a small company—9 people—who focuses on providing online solutions for sex workers. We strive to give them platforms and tools to help them stay independent so they can reach their goals much sooner (and hopefully retire, if that’s their wish).
Our web app (LAMP) is working on 2 countries serving 1.400 customers and 600.000 visitors. We are working on enlarging the team to open 4 more countries by 2020 first quarter.
The company is self-funded, we have been in the market for five years now and we’ve been profitable all the way. This is the result of passion for web development and care for our customers.
Project
The project consists mainly on a custom made (PHP/JS) social network, using WordPress as the core for content management. Customers are able to create and manage accounts like they would on a site like Instagram.
Plus a few other extra functionalities, not only for customers but for customer service and admins as well.
Scope
While there are a lot of front end needs, most of the work will happen on the back end and private administrative sections.
The system is broken down into 18 modules, each as its own WordPress plugin.
We also rely on third party plugins for things such as image optimization, load speed and performance, cronjob handling, and the likes.
Our own theme handles mostly page templates and CSS.
The system is highly configurable and ready to be installed on different countries with different use cases.
We also have integrations with third parties for SMS notifications, and payment processing.
Developer Job Responsibilities
You will be taking the lead developer role in our company to replace our founder (me).
Besides keeping and eye over everything you’ll be improving existing features as well as creating new ones from start to finish.
You’ll also be helping us professionalizing things. The code is not the best, some things are rushed or patched. There isn’t any documentation explaining how the system works or which function does what. With time this may even result in re-designing and re-writing big chunks of code.
Expect to be spending some time learning how things work (of course you will have guidance along the way).
When the work load deserves it, we can talk about hiring junior devs to work with you.
Developer Job Duties

The position requires constant communication with colleagues.
Expertise and hands on experience with software development is needed to be successful in this position
Must be willing to learn LAMP and WordPress.
Strong grasp of CSS3.
Regular exposure to company management, as well as the authority and scope to apply your expertise to many interesting technical problems.

If you have a Github/Bitbucket/Stackoverflow account then please list it. If you contribute to open source projects, please add them. If you have an online presence that in any way supports the role you are applying for, please make sure it’s listed.
App store links or Websites you have worked on

We are also looking for someone who will enjoy working with us and enjoy taking the platform world wide.
There’s hundreds of thousands of sex workers out there that deserve the chance to manage their job (and their money!) on their own terms, and not what someone else dictates for them. Let’s help them out : )

Salary: £32-40k (depending on experience)
Location: UK (remote working)
Duration: Permanent
We are looking to recruit a software developer with excellent visual design skills to join us on a full-time or a part-time basis.
Wordwall.net makes it easy for teachers to create interactive games and printed worksheets for their students. It automates the process of resource design, so teachers can simply enter the content that is appropriate for their class – a list of keywords, definitions, questions or images. Wordwall produces the content in over 60 different templates; for example, gameshow quizzes, crosswords, labelled diagrams and arcade games. It seeks to disrupt the publisher-driven model of paid-for “professionally” made educational content, by putting high-quality content creation in the hands of teachers and making that teacher-made content, freely accessible through our online community.
We are a small company and we all work remotely. Our user base has increased 15 percent month-on-month over the past three years, with low churn and we’re already in profit. We’ve got a product that works and we’re building for the long-term. We want people who want to stick around, grow with us and help make games-based learning accessible to all.
Job requirements:

at least 3 years experience in a front-end or games development role
excellent design skills
ability to implement designs using XML layouts with code-behind
confidence in manipulating graphics and other media files
ability to collaborate with illustrators and sound designers
ability to plan and organise work, ask for help and exercise self-discipline while working remotely

Technologies we use:
HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Canvas API, WebAudio API, C#, ASP.NET MVC, MS-SQL
While we need our team to be committed and accountable for their work, we hope this job would provide an opportunity for those who need to work more flexibly – e.g. it might be suited for those who have caring responsibilities or for whom working a 9-5 office job would be challenging.

RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes
in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress
The goal of this project is to repurpose our JavaScript components currently available
for Weebly, to allow users on the Wordpress platform to embed their podcast episodes
and information on their own custom webpages.
Recent episode player:
This will always display the latest episode published by a user. It includes playback,
timeline bar, description, title and mute buttons.
Podcast Info:
Basic information about the user’s podcast including Category, Genre, Location,
Followers.
Episode Grid:
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a grid format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as transparency vs white bar background for episode titles
(See mockups below)
Episode List
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a List format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as displaying the episode thumbnail image or not. (See
mockups below)
All components must adapt their font style (Title, body, caption) and color to the
webpage theme the user has. All components must offer a color player and a gray
player version, background opacity color, and must be responsive to mobile and
desktop)
Examples of the current plugins in Weebly:
http://www.minimalist-theme.podomatic.net/
http://www.performer-theme.podomatic.net/
http://www.writer-theme.podomatic.net/
http://www.complete-theme.podomatic.net/
Requirements for the embeddable component:
The component should be pure JavaScript, i.e. not an embeddable iframe, and
be enabled either via data attributes or a JavaScript call. i..e the html might look
something like:
The component should make use of Podomatic’s API which uses JSON over REST. A
sample response looks like this:
https://api.podomatic.com/v2/podcasts/5133407/episodes?podcast=true
The following attributes should be customizable:
● The style (grid or list)
● Number of items per page
●
The color scheme (currently light or dark)
●
Whether background images are displayed or not
The component will be styled mostly by the choice of style and color scheme
however it should be possible to override the styles from a global style sheet.
Additionally the layout should be responsive.
The component should load new pages using an infinite scrolling mechanism.
Requirements for the Wordpress plugin integration:
As part of our strategy we also want the above component to be made available
as a Wordpress plugin. To keep the look and feel of the application consistent
this should use the JavaScript file created above. It should also provide the
same level of customizability.
Additional notes
All resulting code and assets will belong to Podomatic. The embeddable code
will be hosted on our own CDN and the Wordpress Plugin on their infrastructure.
Please provide specific instructions on how you would go about building and what in your experience would be useful or relevant to the project.  Also include either a resume or gitbub. Thank you,

Request for Voice recording web app
This is a recording app integrated within the onboarding and publishing experience. It
must have the basic tools to record, edit and publish a basic podcast. Our goal is to
provide a simple tool aimed at beginner podcasters to get them comfortable with
producing content without being overwhelmed with learning how to use professional
recording software.
Software requirements:
● The app should be simple and easy to use. The main focus is to make the
process intuitive and friendly for those starting to Podcast.
● The app should integrate the narrative of Podomatic’s publishing flow (Web
based app for all browser platforms)
● Recording hand-off (upload file to user’s podomatic library) should be included
in the experience process.
We need an estimate for two different versions:
● MVP Requirements:
○ Recording
○ Pause/Resume
○ Upload to library
○ Download to local disk
● Ideal V1 requirements:
○ Recording
○ Pause/Resume
○ Trim Recording
○ Combine Recordings
○ Sound filters (EQ presets)
○ Sound Feedback (Calibrate sound before recording by providing user with
background noise feedback, ideal sound levels, balanced frequency
during recording (too much bass, treble or midrange)

Job Description
Analytics Fire builds custom data analytics software for the solar power industry. We’re looking for a hands-on Solutions Architect to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.
Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skill set to collaborate directly with clients and senior members of the technical team in order to help steer technical decision making and requirements gathering, especially early in the project lifecycle.
This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software deployments and releases than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former embedded Software Engineer, full stack Software Engineer, or Data Engineer that has been previously trained as a Program Manager or is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes.
As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:

(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (and sometimes interactions with potential clients)
(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.
(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.

For reference, here is a list of some technologies we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:

Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular
Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js
Embedded: Embedded Linux, Yocto, C, MQTT
CV: OpenCV, PCL, object identification and tracking
ML: TensorFlow, OpenCV, adaptive parametric modeling, ADTs, N-Dimensional Transforms
Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc
Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc
Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS, GCP, Salesforce platform, ARKit

Your primary responsibility will be to assist in guiding new projects through sales, planning, development, and deployment. This will be accomplished through a combination of client interactions, technical writing, and participation in formal sales, program management, and engineering related processes. Your contributions will naturally be slightly front-loaded towards the sales and planning phases, however you will remain deeply connected to each project through the entire lifecycle in order to ensure conceptual integrity is maintained from design to final implementation.
This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.

Job Description
Analytics Fire builds custom data analytics software for the solar power industry. We’re looking for a hands-on Release Manager to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.
Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the technical skillset and the personality to maintain highly coordinated relationships with key internal and client-side stakeholders in order to help proactively guide projects through planning, development, deployment, release, and DevOps.
This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software deployments and releases than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former embedded Software Engineer, full stack Software Engineer, or Data Engineer that has been previously trained as a Program Manager or is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes.
As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background and skill set    . However, ability to support client-facing interactions (clarifying requirements, negotiating technical approaches, reporting on status, etc) as well as make meaningful internal contributions in a highly technical environment is a hard requirement.
For reference, here is a list of some technologies we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:

Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular
Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js
Embedded: Embedded Linux, Yocto, C, MQTT
CV: OpenCV, PCL, object identification and tracking
ML: TensorFlow, OpenCV, adaptive parametric modeling, ADTs, N-Dimensional Transforms
Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc
Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc
Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS, GCP, Salesforce platform, ARKit

Description of responsibilities:

Develop and maintain well-coordinated relationships with key internal and client-side stakeholders to help drive decision making around production software releases, data engineering, and DevOps.
Participate in collaborative planning discussions and technical decision making early in the project lifecycle to ensure that key decisions are made with reliability, testability, and maintenance in mind.
Monitor and oversee coordination, integration, flow of development, testing, and deployment around multiple parallel projects and threads of engineering execution.
Drive planning and delivery of high quality software releases: Manage change control process during releases, Continuously improve company release processes, Proactively identify and mitigate risks and remove obstacles to releases
Personally plan and lead the team through our most important software releases. Advise and support the team so that they can take on less critical releases on a day-to-day basis.
Continually integrate the QA team and testing engineers into both the requirements gathering and software development processes and report status to clients on a very frequent basis.

This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. (Note: we may be open to US or Canadian citizens living abroad in US-overlapping time zones on a case by case basis.) We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.

Jij schrikt niet van begrippen als AS2/FTP/SQL/http en je weet wat iemand bedoelt met SOAP, REST, XML en API’s. Bij Samskip richt jij je op de interfaces en partnerintegratie, waardoor datacommunicatie efficiënt en foutloos verloopt.
Unlock data, unlock your potential
Samskip is in een digitale transitie: ons legacy systeem wordt vervangen door een door onszelf ontworpen systeem, draaiend in AWS (OutSystems). Jij kunt dit project laten slagen door efficiënte communicatie tussen systemen, eindgebruikers en business partners op te zetten. Wij maken gebruik van het integratieplatform SeeBurger BIS6, met de B2B solution en Managed File Transfer. Als Applicatie Specialist werk je in een klein team op de afdeling Software Development.
Jij houdt je bezig met diverse facetten van het logistieke proces, zoals het:

ontwikkelen van interfaces (o.a. het automatiseren van transportorders van onze klanten of het versturen van statusupdates naar onze klanten);
creëren van system-system interfacing en business-to-business-communicatie door middel van EDI-connecties;
opzetten van data-mappings en de benodigde processen;
ontsluiten van de data die nodig is voor de JIT-strategie van onze klanten, met betrekking tot de real-time track & trace van hun goederen.

You make things happen
Jij houdt je hoofd koel, wat er ook gebeurt – je komt je afspraken na en hebt daarna een voldaan gevoel. Je haalt er energie uit om contact te hebben met collega’s, maar ook met klanten, Samskip eindgebruikers, terminals, autoriteiten en leveranciers. Met beide handen grijp je uitdagende projecten aan en je houdt ervan je te verdiepen in je vak. Je bent zo iemand die leeft naar de quote “Als je doet wat je leuk vindt, hoef je nooit te werken”.
Kom in beweging en solliciteer direct als je beschikt over:

Een mbo-diploma op het gebied van informatica.
Kennis van EDI-communicatie (waarbij je gebruik kunt maken van EDIFACT, XML en ANSI-X12).
Ervaring met Outsystems, Seeburger BIS6 + MFT.
Ervaring met het schrijven van cross-platform interfaces.
Uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, in het Nederlands én Engels.

Software Engineer Information Dialogue
Standplaats: Den Haag
Breng jij bij het CBS AI tot leven?
Over het CBS
In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal. Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.
Je gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).
Voor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier
Wie zoeken wij
Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pré is. Vanzelfsprekend kun je user stories opstellen en gemaakte software systematisch testen. Je bent analytisch, creatief, denkt in oplossingen, leert snel, bent een pionier en kan ingewikkelde materie op aansprekende wijze uitleggen aan collega’s die minder van techniek weten. Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.
Waar kom je te werken
Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, één van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot één van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren. De sfeer van dit team is die van een Start-up, met hoge ambities, grote uitdagingen en de gedrevenheid om de Information Dialogue tot een succes te maken.

Remote,iPhone Photography School,over 1 year ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/dd8ca676-e814-11e8-9ed0-16c6818d7db3,Full Time,Senior PHP/Laravel Developer: Your Dream Work Environment,"
Attention Senior Backend Developers:
“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”
You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
1 - Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
2 - Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
4 - Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?
You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.
We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.
This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.
6 - Work From Anywhere In The World
We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!
If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.
7 - Stability You Can Count On
Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.
Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.
You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.
8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code
Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.
During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.
Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.
Here’s What We Expect From You…

You’re excellent at PHP
You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP
You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years
You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems
You want to participate in scrum teamwork
You have an excellent attention to detail

Routing Squad seeks Backend Engineer (f/m)
Hi,
we are Sudip, Ali, Paul and Aram from the routing squad. Our job is to create and enable routing solutions for our products and customers. We are looking for a backend-focused engineer to join our great squad. The main programming languages we use are Java 8 and Javascript ES6, but we believe that continuous learning is essential in an ever-changing and fast-paced technological environment.
FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US
Our vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 280 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.
HOW THE ROLE WORKS
We gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. With us you will use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.

You have experience with and are open to get deep into OSM and GTFS data formats. Some exposure to service based architectures would be useful. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud computing. As it is our corporate language, you should have good writing and verbal communication skills in English.

ABOUT YOU
You should have experience in writing, maintaining & debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play.

Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.
You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies. 
As it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.

Jane Street is a proprietary quantitative trading firm, focusing primarily on trading equities and equity derivatives. We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.
The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.
As Jane Street grows, the quality of the development tools we use matters more and more.  We increasingly work on the OCaml compiler itself: adding useful language features, fine-tuning the type system and improving the performance of the generated code. Alongside this, we also work on the surrounding toolchain, developing new tools for profiling, debugging, documentation and build automation.
We're looking to hire a developer with experience working on compilers to join us. That experience might be from working on a production compiler in industry or from working on research compilers in an academic setting. No previous experience with OCaml or functional programming languages is required.
We’re looking for candidates for both our London and New York offices. Benefits and compensation are highly competitive.

Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.
We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.
The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.
You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61), and our programming blog (http://ocaml.janestreet.com).

Excellent, zero-premium medical and dental insurance
Free lunch delivered daily from a selection of restaurants
Catered breakfasts and fresh brewed Peet's coffee

We are Datawrapper - a web-based charting tool, and we want you to join us as a client-facing software engineer in our office in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg.
What's this exciting new position about? Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.
The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:


Developing new visualization features for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.

Building & maintaining integrations with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.

Extending Datawrapper to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don’t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.

Who we’re looking for:

We’re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, preferrably full-time, but open to flexible work time arrangements.
You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will not be possible to do this job entirely remote. Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.

On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and Svelte. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.
We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. We’re happy to show you how our stack works.


What the ""client-facing"" part entails:

A significant part of the job will involve interacting with users and customers. be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent
That means we're looking for someone with good communication, interpersonal and written skills.

Strong English skills will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.
Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.
If you have any prior work you can show us, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don’t, please don’t feel discouraged to apply.

What we can offer:


A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, where seven of us work (Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans & David). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse & interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.


Flexible working hours. We're looking for someone who wants to work for us at least four days a week. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.


A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere. We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.


We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills & experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:

NOI
ProntoPro.it è il portale dei professionisti N. 1 in Italia.

Stiamo portando meritocrazia e trasparenza in un mercato finora opaco; vogliamo trasformare sia il modo in cui gli italiani scelgono un professionista sia quello in cui i professionisti trovano clienti.
Siamo una startup in grandissima crescita: a marzo 2015 eravamo 2 persone, oggi siamo più di 100. 29 anni è l'età media, lavoriamo in open space, e riduciamo al minimo la burocrazia (perchè è semplicemente controproducente), ognuno ha grandi responsabilità e impatta direttamente sul nostro successo.
Abbiamo investitori istituzionali del calibro di Immobiliare.it, e angel investor di alto profilo, che lavorano in Google, Facebook, eBay, McKinsey e Unicredit: non abbiamo più i rischi tipici di una startup. Nel 2017 abbiamo avviato il processo di internazionalizzazione conquistando anche il mercato di Austria e Svizzera, e non é finita qua...
Cerchiamo persone che vogliano costruire un colosso nel mondo del digital italiano che impatti fortemente la vita di tutti noi. Non è un lavoro tranquillo – ci mettiamo il cuore.
IL TUO RUOLO

ProntoPro cambierà il modo in cui i clienti trovano i professionisti. Avrai piena visibilità sul business, non solo sulla tua area. Ci si aspetta quindi che tu apporti valore anche a livello architetturale, a livello di prodotto e a livello strategico, senza limitarti ad eseguire ciò che è esplicitamente richiesto.

Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.
Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.
We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.
As a Strider, you’ll find a learning opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:

Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.
Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.
Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.
Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.

A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer
You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.
You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:
9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.
12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride
12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.
1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.
1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.
2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.
6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.
What you’ll be doing

Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.
Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.
Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.
Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).
Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.

You’re a fit for Stride if you have:

3+ years of software development experience
Experience in multiple programming languages
Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks
Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming

What you can expect from us:

Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about
Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)
Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace
No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC
$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development

Constructive (https://constructive.co), a leading brand experience design & digital design agency that works exclusively with social impact organizations is looking for an outstanding technical expert and creative thinker to take over for our current Technology Team Lead, who will sadly be transitioning out of the role at the end of 2018 to live abroad.
If you’re an experienced technologist who wants to work on websites and products that are at the front of the field, knows how to architect and build complex websites, thrives on being a consultative, collaborative problem solver, and believes that the best digital experiences happen when strategy, technology, and design work together, then we’d love to hear from you. If you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want the work you do to make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.
##A bit about the role
Our Technology Team Lead needs a holistic understanding of modern web development techniques and infrastructure. They need experience building strong and scalable websites. They must thrive on being hands-on with development projects. They’ll need a leadership mindset, and must be capable of working on multi-disciplinary teams to communicate complex technological choices to non-developers.
That’s all fancy job-posting language for: you really know your stuff and don’t have a big ego, you take responsibility for the quality of our work and the growth of your team, you still like to get your hands dirty with code, and you’re an effective collaborator—especially with people who don’t understand technology as well as you do.
##A bit about us
We’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We’ve got high expectations and we’ve got the work ethic to match them. We’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.
##A bit about diversity
We believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients. So, in considering if Constructive is a good fit for you, know that all we care about is that you’re qualified to do the job, share most or all of our values, and want to be here. These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant—and if you meet those and add to our diversity, all the better.
##What we need you to do extremely well
This role combines technology team leadership and hands-on development, emphasizing one or the other at any given time. We’ll need you to have strong demonstrated success having done all or most of these things for at least 3-5 years—and a passion for doing them well.


Provide strong technical leadership—both for our internal team of developers, strategists, and designers; and for our clients and occasional external dev partners.
Manage and mentor junior developers—two in-house developers, one ongoing external partner, and any additional developers when project load requires it.

Guide development team and our company on planning, prioritizing, mitigating risks, and balancing technical debt to meet project milestones so that we deliver exceptional work that meets expectations.

Work with stakeholders to define strategic goals and the context in which they need to be met, gather requirements, and produce technical documentation that makes it very clear how technology will help achieve them.

Develop requirements, specifications, and architecture to document what we’re building and what’s been built.

Lead development of ambitious digital products, serving as the point person for both the end-to-end process and the outcomes we deliver, aligning our work with Constructive’s broader strategic position as a leading brand experience design firm.

Be a hands-on developer who takes on specific aspects of complex jobs or plays a lead developer role on a project when needed.

Review code and provide feedback on work done by other developers; oversee the UAT and QA processes in coordination with project managers.

Improve best practices, recommend tools, and build frameworks that make our work more efficient, effective, and technically front-of field.

Be the face of Constructive’s technical expertise throughout client engagements, in the development community, and when needed in our sales cycle.

Contribute to developing proposals and estimates for technical projects, particularly those with complex requirements.

Lead vetting and hiring of web developers and external development partners.

Be a team player who knows how to lead, has a bias towards listening, takes serious pride in their work, and is always looking for our process and results to be better the next time out.
It definitely helps if you also have a good sense of humor

##Expertise that’s important in our work
Right now, these are the specific technologies and tasks that are essential to our work. We’ll need you to have about 5 years of experience in most of these things, and we’re very open to new ideas on which specific technologies and tools can improve on what we have.

Expert Wordpress & Drupal development (Minimum 5 years of experience)
Expert front-end development experience
Strong experience with Webpack / Gulp / SCSS
Strong experience doing large-scale content migrations
Strong experience doing third-party integrations (Solr, Salesforce, Mailchimp, Fluxx)
Experience with Data Visualization (D3, Highcharts)
Experience with Infrastructure, System Administration & DevOps
Experience with ES6, Node, React

##What’s in it for you?
Work/Life balance matters at Constructive, and we do our best to make sure everyone is well-taken care of with a great mix of salary, benefits and perks, opportunities for professional growth, and a healthy dose of time off. We also always reward individual initiative and outsized contributions to our collective success. Added to your base salary, here’s what we have on tap for 2018-2019 to add:

We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.
Skills & Requirements
Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.
We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.

“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”

Requirements
Conditions of Employment
You must be a United States Citizen or National.
Background investigation, credit check, and drug test required.
You must be registered for Selective Service, if applicable.
If selected, you may be required to complete a one year probationary period.
You must meet all qualification requirements upon the closing date of this announcement.
Qualifications
GS-09: To be eligible at the GS-9 level, you must have at least one full year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-7 grade level in the Federal service as defined below; or two full years of progressively higher level graduate education or master's degree in a related field (e.g., Information Technology, Computer Science, Law, Criminal Justice) or an equivalent graduate degree such as an LL.B or J.D.; or a combination of both specialized experience and education as explained below.

Specialized experience involves performing the following types of duties: assisting attorneys with trial preparation, including making recommendations on how to proceed with trial presentations; utilizing office automation tools in order to create physical and digital trial presentations; working with investigators, agents, and legal support staff; handling a wide variety of evidence and discovery; and providing technical assistance to litigation teams.

Combining Education and Experience: A combination of experience and graduate level educationcan be used if, when combined, are equivalent to 100% of the qualification requirement. Only graduate level education in excess of the first full year can be used in this calculation.

To calculate your percentage of specialized experience, divide the total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%.

Specialized Experience involves performing the following types of duties: Working in a legal environment providing technical advice to litigation teams on legal automation requirements and systems capabilities; organizing and managing case specific discovery; analyzing complex litigation support requirements to develop or recommend appropriate strategies to meet litigation needs; using automated litigation support technology such as Trial Director, Concordance, Case Map, Eclipse, or related programs to organize voluminous case information for retrieval, prepare computerized trial presentations, and index digital evidence; researching, analyzing and summarizing relevant legal precedents; and preparing and maintaining a variety of trial-related documents.

Combining Education and Experience:A combination of experience and graduate level education can be used if, when combined, are equivalent to 100% of the qualification requirement. Only graduate level education in excess of the first two years can be used in this calculation. To calculate your percentage of graduate education, first determine the total number of graduate level hours that exceed 36 semester hours (or your school's definition of two years of graduate study), then divide the total number of your excess graduate semester hours by 18 (or your school's definition of one year of graduate study). To calculate your percentage of specialized experience, divide the total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%.
