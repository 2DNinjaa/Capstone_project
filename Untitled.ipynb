We are committed to developing the future generation of cyber scientists, analysts and professionals. And we are always keen to hear from talented and experienced people who wish to join us in our vision to be the leading cyber security advisor.\\nAbout You\\nYou are a person who enjoys designing and implementing machine learning architectures as much as you do doing the science. You would enjoy the opportunity to build out your vision for a data science and machine learning capability in a highly technical company. You relish the challenge of unlocking the latent value in data to enable teams and organisations to succeed. You are fascinated by cyber security (even if you are not yourself a practitioner).\\nYou want to teach machines.\\nYou have a strong foundation in statistics and probability, can code in either Python or R, and have used at least one open-source machine-learning library or API to perform analytics. You have confidently built research-grade software and are comfortable prototyping ideas in your programming language of choice, although we’d certainly be keen to meet anyone who has pushed machine learning code into a production environment. You are familiar with large-scale data processing-relevant aspects of Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and/or Google GCP, along with modern computing architectures.\\nAt minimum, you have practical understanding and experience of linear models, decision trees and neural networks, possibly through industry or academia. You have used (or are interested in learning) tools/frameworks such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, etc.\\nYou may also have theoretical or practical understanding of any of natural language processing, graph theory, algorithm design, or a specific research area in data science or machine learning.\\nAbout the Team\\nThe team is new to NCC Group sitting within the Group CTO Office, and works closely with our Research Directors. To say it is small and perfectly formed is an understatement. You will be part of a two-person team dedicated to data science and machine learning, with one person in Europe and the other in North America. This team will work on highly impactful deliverables that will be visible across both the organization as a whole. While we ask applied, real-world questions, there will be opportunities to also publish and present your work.\\nWhile this role allows for a high degree of creativity with the opportunity to strongly influence our analytics roadmap, you will be among many inspiring, collaborative, and passionate colleagues within NCC Group. With respect to applied analytics, there is already a wider community of data science professionals who would be peers at NCC Group, primarily supporting our Managed Detection & Response business located in the Netherlands.\\nAbout the Role\\nYou will work as part of a team across NCC Group to:\\nIdentify and understand our available data.\\nDesign and implement our group approach to machine learning, applied analytics, and data science\\nWork with other departments to ensure governance, compliance and security of our data science activities.\\nPerform data science tasks to supply insights across teams within NCC Group.\\nUltimately, help define and deliver our future machine learning strategy.\\nOther:\\nSome travel to other offices may be required',\n",
